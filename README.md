The application supports three distinct user roles (admin, user, and tour guide), with dynamic adjustments to the site's appearance and functionality based on the logged-in user role. This project demonstrates a strong focus on creating a user-friendly, secure, and responsive platform.

Responsive Design: Optimized for PC, laptop, and mobile devices using media queries.
Advanced Authentication: Includes features such as password reset and account recovery.
Booking System: Users can book tours and tour guides, with validation to prevent double bookings on the same date.
