Overview:
Developed a comprehensive tourism management system as a graduation project using Node.js. The application supports three distinct user roles (admin, user, and tour guide), with dynamic adjustments to the site's appearance and functionality based on the logged-in user role. This project demonstrates a strong focus on creating a user-friendly, secure, and responsive platform.

Key Features:

Dynamic Interface: Adapts based on user roles, providing tailored experiences for admins, users, and tour guides.
Security: Implements encryption, input sanitization, and rate limiting to ensure robust security.
Responsive Design: Optimized for PC, laptop, and mobile devices using media queries.
Advanced Authentication: Includes features such as password reset and account recovery.
Booking System: Users can book tours and tour guides, with validation to prevent double bookings on the same date.
Tour Guide Booking: Users can book a tour guide for a specific date, with a validation system ensuring availability. Bookings require tour guide approval.
Chat System: Activated upon booking approval to facilitate communication between users and tour guides.
Review System: Allows users to review tour guides, enhancing service quality.
Profile Management: Enables creation and management of user and tour guide profiles.
Email Notifications: Automated notifications for various actions within the application.
Place Listings: Displays detailed information, images, and safety tips for various tourist attractions. Users can view available tours based on the tour guide's location, including tour details, prices, and reviews.
Place Checking: Users can view detailed descriptions and safety tips for each place.
Favorites Management: Users can add and remove favorite places.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for places based on specific criteria.
Tour Availability Validation: Ensures that a tour is not booked multiple times on the same date, providing accurate availability status.
